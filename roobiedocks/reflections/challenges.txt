1. I have been a mobile application developer primarily working on Android
various cross-platform tools for more than 4 years. Am i taking the right
decision in learning Ruby at this point in my career ?
2. Does completing the Ruby nanodegree help me get a job in the current
market ?
3. Does learning Ruby help me to work independently as a freelancer ?
4. How is the future for a Ruby and Ruby on Rails developer considering the
current situation ?
