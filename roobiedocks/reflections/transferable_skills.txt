In my IT career i started out as a Mainframe application developer learning and
working on languages like COBOL, FORTRAN with REXX, JCL and VSAM files. Along
with IBM DB2. After 2 years i was bored of Mainframe since it became a routine
job and moved into Mobile development with just basic knowledge of core Java alone.
After that i have self-learned lots of frameworks and languages to improve
myself as a developer.

1. Self-Learning capacity
2. Adaptability
